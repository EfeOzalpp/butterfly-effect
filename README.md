A weight-based questionnaire feeds continuous input into a deterministic 2D rendering system, whose output is reused as sprite textures in a Three.js scene visualizing both personalized and previous responses. 

Live at: https://butterflyeff3ct.online/

Notable implementations:
- Stores survey results together with user category (visitor, student, staff/faculty) in a Sanity.io schema and uses this data after completion for sorting and visualization.
- Uses a grid-based layout system for 2D canvas rendering to manage sprite placement and prevent overlap with other UI elements.
- Renders graphics as reusable off-screen sprite textures, including snapshotting particle-based visuals after a short simulation step.
- Maintains performance and scalability by limiting the number of render variants, reusing cached textures, preventing duplicate texture generation on first load, and preparing textures off-screen for smoother initial rendering.
