# Sprite Performance Memory Note

Chrome DevTools heap snapshot numbers for the first 3 seconds of initial 3D
scene load. These are JS/object-retention measurements, not GPU/VRAM numbers.

Why this still matters: the optimization here was about reducing sprite
material/texture churn, retained objects, and cache pressure on the JS side.
GPU memory should be measured separately with browser/WebGL tools or Task Manager.
